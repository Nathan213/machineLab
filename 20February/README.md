The box depicts a bowl and a teapot. Inside the teapot is sand.
# Quarter
At quarter time, the teapot is tilted and pours out 25% of the sand. the sand will fall into the bowl, which will lower the bowl’s platform by 25%.
Once the bowl’s platform reaches 25%, a certain activity will take place
# Half
At half-time, the teapot pours out another 25% of the sand. The bowl lowers to halfway, and another action takes place on the side.
# Full
In an hour's time, the teapot pours out all its sand into the bowl. The bowl’s platform hits the lowest level, which triggers an action that raises the bowl and pours all its sand back into the teapot.

# Alternative
An hour glass is secured at the center of the box. Instead of having the two ends of the hourglass secured, the sides are unattached bowls. At every hour, the two bowls dettach. Then, the bowls follow the pulley track and swap places. The bottom bowl remains upright until it reaches the top, and the top bowl flips as it reaches the bottom.
