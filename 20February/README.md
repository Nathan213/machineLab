#Alternative
An hour glass is secured at the center of the box. Instead of having the two ends of the hourglass secured, the sides are unattached bowls. At every hour, the two bowls dettach. THen, the bowls follow the pulley track and swap places. The bottom bowl remains upright until it reaches the top, and the top bowl flips as it reaches the bottom.
