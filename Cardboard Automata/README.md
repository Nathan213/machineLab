This project was very fun to make. Building and visualizing cams and cranks were very helpful in theoretically understanding how they work. Some of the main chalenges I encountered in this project had to do with stability. I will detail each instance below. 

## First Failure
The first issue I identified and fixed was the instability of the crank shaft. Because the motor was moving so fast, the horizontal section of the shaft was being pushed and pulled too violently, causing the tip of the shaft to tilt up. Here is a short demonstration of the issue:
